# About This Site

This site is inspired by macOS [Big Sur](https://www.apple.com/in/macos/big-sur/) and [Catalina](https://www.apple.com/bw/macos/catalina/), developed using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) and [UnoCSS](https://uno.antfu.me/), and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Some of the icons are generated using [sindresorhus/file-icon-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/file-icon-cli). Also, Thanks a lot to [@Renovamen](https://github.com/Renovamen).

The source code is hosted [here](https://github.com/Arghajit47/macos-portfolio).
